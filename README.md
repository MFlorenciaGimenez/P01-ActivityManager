# Activity Manager 📝

This project is a **dynamic activity manager web app** created to practice **DOM manipulation** and JavaScript object management.

## 📝 Project Description

The goal of this project is to allow users to:

- Add new activities with a **title**, **description**, and **image URL**.
- Display all activities dynamically as cards on the page.
- Remove any activity by clicking a delete button.

The app demonstrates the use of:

- **JavaScript classes** to manage data (`Activity` and `Repository`).  
- **DOM manipulation** to create, update, and remove elements dynamically.  
- Event handling for forms and buttons.
